# VR-Treadmill

script that converts mouse movement into joystick movement for a VR treadmill.
(requires Python3)

to bind the virtual gamepad using steam input, open the script in a text editor and comment out the indicated line. when the bind is set up, uncomment the line and restart the script.

REQUIRED:
pynput
vgamepad

FUTURE IDEAS:
using an openxr library to directly control the game instead of a virtual xbox360 controller

# Golly's Version

Instead of doing a hard reset, there's now more of a decay so there's not so much jitter. Also reworked some things. Hope this helps! :D

# Golly's Notes

- As of 9/25 1:15PM EST I haven't had a chance to test this out properly. It theoretically works but I need to hop in-game to test it and I'm technically on lunch rn :P
